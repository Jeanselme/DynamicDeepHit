# DynamicDeepHit
This repository is a Pytorch implementation of the paper :  [Dynamic Deep Hit](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8681104). Original implementation in Tensorflow can be found at [chl8856/Dynamic-DeepHit](https://github.com/chl8856/Dynamic-DeepHit).


The code is based on the [Deep Survival Machines repository](https://github.com/autonlab/DeepSurvivalMachines) and use a similar module structure.


### Code Description
All the code related to Dynamic Deep Hit is loacted in `ddh`. Only API should be used for application.

An example is available in the `examples` folder.

## TODOs
- Full documentation
- Further testing to ensure the model is reproducing the original paper's performance
